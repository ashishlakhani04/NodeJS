Async Basics:-
	App will run while it is waiting for something to happen(MultiThread)

		/*
			console.log('Starting app');

			setTimeout(()=>{
				console.log('Inside from setTimeout!')
			},2000); // to prove that node is Async

			console.log('Finishing up');
		*/
		==> 
			Starting app
			Finishing up
			Inside from setTimeout!
		<==

		In Async programme, we use four things
			=> call stack
			=> node API(eg-setTimeout)
			=> callback queue
			=> event loop

		after compelting the time of node API they have to wait in callback queue
		then event loop comes into picture, it checks if call stack is empty, if it is
		, it will execute the statements in callback queue, otherwise from call stack.

Callback functions :- it can be passed as an argument from any function, and is executing 	
						after some event happens.
